# Be your own Person

I. INTRO:

  1. BYOP Site: https://byop.netlify.app/

  2. This is an App to generate a Face/Name/Quote at Random, App then displays:
     
     a. A Dog Face.
     
     b. A First Name.
     
     c. A Quote/Thoughts.

  3. Rationale behind the App is the ability to generate a Personality off the 3 Parameters above, so that a Creative can build a Fictional Character from scratch.

II. NOTES:

  1. Built with HTML/CSS/JS/API.
  
  2. BYOP API's:

     a. Face - https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random
     
     b. Name - https://random-data-api.com/api/users/random_user
     
     c. Quote - https://goquotes-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/random?count=1
  
  3. As a Freelance Website and Web App Developer, I was able to license this App to a Team of Creatives for 12 months use.

III. OPTIMIZATION:

  1. Access to a free Deepfake Face API.
  
  2. Pull in other Info from Name API, to include other fictional pieces of info for the fictional Character such as:

     a. Birth Date

     b. Email Address

     c. Phone Number
  
  3. Add a Form so User can create Credentials.
  
  4. Add a Free-Form Text Box that acts as a Note Function so that User can build a Backstory.
  
  5. Save functionality so that User can Save a 'Person'
  
  6. Link with Server to keep and serve User and Character info.
