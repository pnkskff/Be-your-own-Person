# Be your own Person

I. INTRO:

BYOP Site: https://byop.netlify.app/

This is an App to generate a Face, Name, and a Quote.

Idea is to generate a Personality off the 3 Facets, so that a Creative can build a Fictional Character.

II. NOTES:

  1. Built with HTML/CSS/JS/API.
  2. BYOP API's:

     a. Face - https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random
     
     b. Name - https://random-data-api.com/api/users/random_user
     
     c. Quote - https://goquotes-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/random?count=1

III. OPTIMIZATION:

  1. Access to a free Deepfake Face API.
  2. Pull in other Info from Name API, to include other fictional pieces of info for the fictional Character such as:

     a. Birth Date

     b. Email Address

     c. Phone Number
  3. Add a Form so User can create Credentials.
  4. Add a Free-Form Text Box that acts as a Note Function so that User can build a Backstory.
  5. Save functionality so that User can Save a 'Person'
  6. Link with Server to keep and serve User and Character info.
